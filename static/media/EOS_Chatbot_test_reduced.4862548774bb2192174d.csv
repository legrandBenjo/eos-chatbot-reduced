String Contactors,"DC Contactors in the Combiner section of the DC Block Control Cabinet that join individual battery strings to the internal common buss, on positive and negative; DC Contactors in the Combiner section that join individual battery strings to the internal common buss, on positive and negative"
Maintenance Resistor,"(formerly MRR) Discharge resistor for ""battery reset"" and maintenance/emergency discharge operations"
Maintenance Resistor Assembly,Enclosure containing the Energy Blocks Maintenance Resistor that installed on top of the Energy Block Control Cabinet
Maintenance Resistor Contactors,"DC Contactors in the Combiner section of the DC Block Control Cabinet that join shared Maintenance Resistor to the internal common buss, on positive and negative"
Enabled/Disable(of a component),"in active operation or not (for Energy String, contactors may be opened for SoC management); in active operation or not (for Energy String, contactors may be opened for SoC management)"
On-Line/Off-Line(of a component),"available for active operation by Enabling or not (if not, requires service support); available for active operation by Enabling or not (if not, requires service support)"
Deviation,indicates a measurement outside of the normal group (i.e. detectable by excessive difference between max and min of the reading)
Discrepancy,indicates a measurement is inconsistent with a separate indirect or calculated measurement  (e.g. sum of series battery voltages not matched to direct battery string voltage)
Mismatch,"In regards to BMS measurements, an excessive difference between two measurements of the same physical quantity"
Fast Stop,An input to the BMS (electrical or by manual push-button) which opens all high-voltage DC contactors by hardware as a protection mechanism
Boost Procedure,Process to charge the battery from voltages below the minimum operating voltage of the site inverter/PCS in order to enable inverter/PCS operation
Boost Port,High Voltage DC connection port for the Boost Procedure
Formation Procedure,"Process of energizing batteries from less than 10V at a battery module level.  This occurs during charging as virgin batteries for the first time after production OR after a very long period since last charging.  After all battery modules are greater than 10V, the Boost procedure may be used.  (At a string level, 150-200V is the voltage threshold below which to use the Formation procedure.)  Formation requires all battery string currents be less than 0.5A/string."
Work-In Cycles,"Cycles that occur of a new battery module (or system) before the battery was been cycled sufficiently that is has reached its steady operating performance characteristics.  ""Work-In"" may take from 3 to 5, or even 20 cycles, during which the battery could perform with lower series capacity and potentially limit the overall system."
Rest Cycle,Weekly operation to drain the battery in order to reset the electro-chemical features of the battery for improved efficiency performance AND to ensure the BMS Coulomb counter is reset for accurate accounting of the State-of-Charge
Step-Down Discharge,"A discharge profile where the battery undergoes a rated power discharge until the minimum battery voltage is reached.  Once reached, the discharge power is reduced to 10% of the rated discharge power.  This discharge continues until the minimum battery voltage is reached again, at which point the discharge is terminated."
Ramp-Down Discharge,"A discharge profile where the battery undergoes a discharge without any limit commanded by the BMS until a minimum battery voltage is reached.  Once reached, the BMS begins to regulate the discharge power by closed-loop control to prevent the minimum battery voltage from decreasing further."
Data Aggregator,"Eos embedded computer device installed one per site to provide diagnostics support, local engineering logging and remote monitoring service data management"
Energy Aggregator,"Eos embedded computer device installed one per site to provide diagnostics remote monitoring management, as well as providing a single point of control for the operation of multiple Energy Block units."
